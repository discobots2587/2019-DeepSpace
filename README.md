## 2019-DeepSpace
There are several [wikipages](https://github.com/discobots2587/2019-DeepSpace/wiki) in our 2019-DeepSpace Github repo which summarizes all of the necessary resources and info all coders need to contribute code. Especially check out the *MUST READ* section.

All developers are expected to join the `#coding` and `#github` channels in the [Discobots Slack Page](https://discobots.slack.com).
* `#coding` - any discussion for our team will take place here
* `#github` - auto-generated messages from any activity in this GitHub repository will take place here

The Discobots 2019 Coding team includes:
* Mentors: @Peter Vu (lead), @nolanshah (part-time)
* Contributors: @yunchao, @rmeno_12, @Alaric, Dane
* Interested: @rykerg, Dean, @Dan Bizman, @Jonathan_T, @akkim3, @ekint, @Andrew Valdez

PM the lead coding mentor directly on Slack if you have any questions or need direction for current/new tasks.
